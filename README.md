# DistributedSystemsModalLogic
A repo to keep papers in topology, modal logic, and distributed systems. 
Here I will store papers for summer interns to get at and read. Subdirectories will be created in distributed systems, general modal logic, topology and modal logic, and maybe coalgebras.  Sepeate directories will be used for organizing each topic
